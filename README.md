# KNN vs Locally Weighted Regression (LWR)

This project compares the performance of **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression** and **Locally Weighted Regression (LWR)** using:

- 📈 California Housing Dataset
- 🩺 Diabetes Dataset from `sklearn.datasets`

## 🔍 Objectives

1. ✅ Use multiple features for regression
2. ✅ Implement and evaluate both KNN and LWR algorithms
3. ✅ Compare their performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## 📊 Final MSE Comparison

| Dataset   | KNN MSE         | LWR MSE         |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| Housing   | 4,386,370,000    | 89,957,570,000   |
| Diabetes  | 4,119.70         | 3,727.62         |
